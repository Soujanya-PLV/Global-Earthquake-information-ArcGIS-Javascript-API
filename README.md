# Global-Earthquake-information-ArcGIS-Javascript-API
This repository has been created as a part of my EADG module project.

## Project description:
The project aims to provide an enhanced understanding and effective communication of earthquake alert information.

The virtual globe visualisation using ArcGIS Javascript API consists of the following:
  1. Visualisation of different PAGER alerts from USGS.
  2. Visualisation of the plate tectonics on the earth's surface adds to the understanding of the earthquake occurrence.
  3. Option to select a particular earthquake, zoom to its location, obtain information such as its magnitude, location and date and be redirected to the USGS website for further study of that earthquake.
  4. Option to search a particular place and then study the alerts in that area.

By visualising in 3D, users can grasp the impact and severity of seismic events and incorporate the necessary points in hazard planning by ensuring public safety and facilitating effective response and recovery efforts.
As earthquakes continue to pose a significant threat to the world, this project aims to take a step towards disaster resilience planning and mitigation.
